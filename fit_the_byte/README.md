# fit_the_byte

Some file upload systems limit the size of image files.

If you input the name of image and the limitaion of the size, this program automatically fits the byte for the limitation as big as possible.

You don't need to calculate profit size.

You can see the demonstration that the program resizes a 2 MB image file to 1 MB.
